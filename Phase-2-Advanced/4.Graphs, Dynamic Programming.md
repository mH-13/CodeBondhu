Let’s move to **Phase 2: Advanced Topics (Weeks 5-8)**. I’ll expand on **Graphs, Dynamic Programming, OOP, and DBMS** with **deep dives, real-world use cases, coding patterns, and interview strategies**.

### **Weeks 5-6: Graphs and Graph Algorithms**  
#### **1. Graph Basics**  
**What it is**:  
- A collection of **nodes (vertices)** and **edges** connecting them.  
- **Types**:  
  - **Directed vs. Undirected**: Edges have direction (e.g., social media followers) vs. no direction (e.g., Facebook friends).  
  - **Weighted vs. Unweighted**: Edges have values (e.g., road distances).  

**Representations**:  
1. **Adjacency List**:  
   - Dictionary/hash map where each node maps to its neighbors.  
   - **Space**: O(V + E).  
2. **Adjacency Matrix**:  
   - 2D array where `matrix[i][j] = 1` if there’s an edge from i to j.  
   - **Space**: O(V²).  

**Example**:  
```python  
# Directed graph using adjacency list  
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D'],
    'C': ['E'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['B']
}
```

#### **2. Graph Traversal**  
**1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:  
- **How it works**: Explore nodes level by level using a **queue**.  
- **Use Cases**: Shortest path in unweighted graphs, social network friend suggestions.  
- **Time**: O(V + E).  

**Example**:  
```python  
from collections import deque  

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    visited.add(start)
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        print(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)

bfs(graph, 'A')  # Output: A → B → C → D → E  
```

**2. Depth-First Search (DFS)**:  
- **How it works**: Explore as far as possible along a branch before backtracking (uses a **stack**).  
- **Use Cases**: Maze solving, cycle detection.  
- **Time**: O(V + E).  

**Example (Recursive)**:  
```python  
def dfs(graph, node, visited):
    if node not in visited:
        print(node)
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)

dfs(graph, 'A', set())  # Output: A → B → D → C → E  
```

#### **3. Shortest Path Algorithms**  
**1. Dijkstra’s Algorithm**:  
- **Purpose**: Shortest path in **weighted graphs** with non-negative weights.  
- **How it works**: Use a priority queue to greedily select the node with the smallest tentative distance.  
- **Time**: O((V + E) log V) with a heap.  

**Example**:  
```python  
import heapq  

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    heap = [(0, start)]
    while heap:
        current_dist, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
        if current_dist > distances[node]:
            continue
        for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:
            distance = current_dist + weight
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(heap, (distance, neighbor))
    return distances  

# Weighted graph example (node: [(neighbor, weight)])
weighted_graph = {
    'A': [('B', 4), ('C', 2)],
    'B': [('D', 5)],
    'C': [('D', 1)],
    'D': []
}
print(dijkstra(weighted_graph, 'A'))  # {'A': 0, 'B': 4, 'C': 2, 'D': 3}  
```

**2. Bellman-Ford**:  
- **Purpose**: Handles graphs with **negative weights** (but not negative cycles).  
- **Time**: O(V * E).  

---

#### **4. Cycle Detection**  
- **Undirected Graphs**: Use DFS and check if a neighbor is visited and not the parent.  
- **Directed Graphs**: Track recursion stack in DFS.  

**Example (Undirected Graph)**:  
```python  
def has_cycle_undirected(graph):
    visited = set()
    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            if dfs_cycle(node, None, visited, graph):
                return True
    return False  

def dfs_cycle(node, parent, visited, graph):
    visited.add(node)
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            if dfs_cycle(neighbor, node, visited, graph):
                return True
        elif neighbor != parent:
            return True
    return False  
```

#### **5. Common Graph Problems**  
1. **Number of Islands** (LeetCode #200) – Use BFS/DFS.  
2. **Course Schedule** (LeetCode #207) – Detect cycles in directed graphs (topological sort).

### **Week 7: Dynamic Programming (DP)**  
#### **1. DP Fundamentals**  
**What it is**:  
- Break problems into overlapping subproblems and reuse solutions (via **memoization** or **tabulation**).  

**Key Terms**:  
- **State**: Parameters defining a subproblem (e.g., `dp[i][j]`).  
- **Transition**: Relation between states (e.g., `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`).  

**Approach**:  
1. **Top-Down (Memoization)**: Recursive with caching.  
2. **Bottom-Up (Tabulation)**: Iterative with table filling.  

---

#### **2. Classic DP Problems**  
**1. 0-1 Knapsack**:  
- **Problem**: Maximize value of items in a knapsack with weight capacity.  
- **State**: `dp[i][w]` = max value using first `i` items and weight `w`.  
- **Transition**:  
  ```  
  if weight[i] <= w:  
      dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], dp[i-1][w - weight[i]] + value[i])  
  else:  
      dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]  
  ```  

**Example**:  
```python  
def knapsack(values, weights, capacity):
    n = len(values)
    dp = [[0]*(capacity+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for w in range(1, capacity+1):
            if weights[i-1] <= w:
                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], dp[i-1][w - weights[i-1]] + values[i-1])
            else:
                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]
    return dp[n][capacity]

values = [60, 100, 120]
weights = [10, 20, 30]
capacity = 50
print(knapsack(values, weights, capacity))  # 220 (items 2 and 3)  
```

**2. Coin Change**:  
- **Problem**: Minimum coins to make a target amount.  
- **State**: `dp[i]` = min coins to make amount `i`.  
- **Transition**:  
  ```  
  dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1) for each coin  
  ```  

**Example**:  
```python  
def coin_change(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, amount + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1

print(coin_change([1, 2, 5], 11))  # 3 (5 + 5 + 1)  
```

**3. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**:  
- **Problem**: Find the longest subsequence common to two strings.  
- **State**: `dp[i][j]` = LCS length of `s1[0..i]` and `s2[0..j]`.  
- **Transition**:  
  ```  
  if s1[i] == s2[j]:  
      dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1  
  else:  
      dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])  
  ```

### **Week 7 Practice Problems**  
1. **Climbing Stairs** (LeetCode #70) – Classic DP starter.  
2. **House Robber** (LeetCode #198) – Decision-based DP.  
3. **Word Break** (LeetCode #139) – String + DP.

### **Key DP Interview Tips**  
- Always start by asking, *“Can this problem be broken into overlapping subproblems?”*.  
- Draw the state transition table on paper before coding.
