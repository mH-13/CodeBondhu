### **1. System Design Primer for Bangladesh Interviews**  
*(Commonly asked in mid-senior roles at companies like Augmedix, Brain Station 23, and Grameenphone)*  

#### **A. Key Concepts to Master**  
1. **Scalability Basics**:  
   - Vertical vs. horizontal scaling (e.g., adding RAM vs. adding servers).  
   - Load balancing (round-robin, least connections).  
2. **Database Design**:  
   - SQL vs. NoSQL tradeoffs (e.g., "Why MongoDB for a social media feed?").  
   - Caching strategies (Redis, Memcached).  
3. **APIs & Microservices**:  
   - REST vs. GraphQL (e.g., "When to use GraphQL for a Dhaka traffic app?").  
   - Rate limiting and authentication (JWT, OAuth).  

#### **B. Example Problem: Design DhakaRide (Uber Clone)**  
**Requirements**:  
- Real-time ride matching.  
- Payment integration (bKash/SSLCOMMERZ).  
- Peak-hour scalability.  

**Solution Outline**:  
1. **Components**:  
   - **Driver/Passenger Service**: Geolocation tracking (WebSocket).  
   - **Matching Algorithm**: Proximity-based using spatial indexing (Geohash).  
   - **Payment Service**: Integrate bKash API with idempotent transactions.  
2. **Database**:  
   - SQL for user data (ACID compliance).  
   - Redis for real-time driver locations.  
3. **Bangladesh-Specific Edge Cases**:  
   - Network latency during load-shedding.  
   - Localized payment gateway failures.

### **1. Advanced System Design: Bangladesh Case Studies**  
#### **A. Design Pathao’s Ride-Matching System**  
**Requirements**:  
- Real-time driver-rider matching in Dhaka’s traffic.  
- Surge pricing during peak hours (e.g., rain, office rush).  
- Integration with bKash for payments.  

**Key Components**:  
1. **Geolocation Service**:  
   - Use **WebSocket** for real-time driver updates.  
   - **Geohash** to partition Dhaka into zones (e.g., Gulshan: "sxyz", Mirpur: "t123").  
2. **Matching Algorithm**:  
   - Prioritize nearest drivers using a **priority queue** (min-heap by distance).  
   - **Fallback**: If no drivers in zone, expand search radius.  
3. **Surge Pricing**:  
   - Dynamic pricing based on demand-supply ratio (e.g., 1.5x when drivers < 10% of requests).  
   - Store pricing history in **Redis** for fast lookups.  
4. **Payment Gateway**:  
   - Use idempotent API calls to bKash to avoid duplicate charges.  
   - **Example Flow**:  
     ```python  
     def process_payment(user_id, amount):  
         transaction_id = generate_unique_id()  
         response = bkash_api.charge(user_id, amount, transaction_id)  
         if response.status == "FAILED":  
             retry_with_exponential_backoff()  
     ```  

**Bangladesh-Specific Challenges**:  
- **Network Reliability**: Handle frequent 3G/4G drops with offline queuing (e.g., store requests locally on the rider’s app and sync when online).  
- **Localization**: Support Bengali language in notifications.  

---

#### **B. Design a Scalable Election Results Platform (e.g., Bangladesh National Elections)**  
**Requirements**:

- Ensure data integrity and prevent tampering.  

**Architecture**:  
1. **Data Ingestion**:  
   - Use **Apache Kafka** to stream results from polling stations to centralized servers.  
2. **Data Storage**:  
   - **SQL Database**: Postgres for transactional data (votes per candidate).  
   - **Blockchain**: Hash results per constituency and store on a private blockchain for auditability.  
3. **Caching**:  
   - Use **CDN** (e.g., Cloudflare) to serve static results (candidate profiles) from Dhaka/Mumbai nodes.  
   - **Redis** for real-time vote counters.  
4. **Security**:  
   - **JWT Tokens** for API authentication.  
   - Rate limit users to 10 requests/minute to prevent DDoS attacks.
